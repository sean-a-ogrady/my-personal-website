# Sean O'Grady's Personal Website

## Overview
 
Welcome to the repository for my personal website! This website serves as a portfolio and a space to showcase my skills, projects, and interests. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a word cloud generated from my Obsidian notes, a bio section, and links to my social media profiles.

## Features

- **Word Cloud**: A dynamic, interactive word cloud generated from my Obsidian notes, visualized using D3.js.
- **Bio Section**: A brief biography that provides an overview of my background, interests, and career goals.
- **Social Media Links**: Quick links to my Instagram, LinkedIn, and GitHub profiles.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive and works well on various screen sizes.

## Future Improvements 

- [ ] Automate the export of the daily word JSON file from my Obsidian notes to generate daily word cloud (see https://github.com/sean-a-ogrady/obsidian-word-scraper)
- [ ] Integrate more interactive elements
- [ ] Add a projects section to showcase my portfolio
